<h1>My Website</h1><h2> - aka my trash site for experimenting with html and css</h2>

<p>(I'm still learning, so please have mercy...)</p>
<p> This site will be constantly (more or so) updated to my progress and accumulation of projects.</p>
<p> Its still a long way to go, but I'm trying to get better.</p>

<p> As for now, thanks for visiting this repository - itsjules :)</p>
